This project uses the timer of stm32f401 to keep the precise measure of time, the timer3 is configured in "up" mode the 80MHz frequency is divided by 8000, to give 10KHz, then a prescaler of 10000 is used to reload the counter value which gives 1.00006s period, a timer interrupt subroutine is used to update the values of seconds, minutes and hours, the liquid crystal display is used to display the time.
